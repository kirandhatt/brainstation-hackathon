# Protein Planner
Protein Planner allows users to enter foods to see if they will hit their protein target. Our front-end web app calculates nutrient amounts based on protein serving.

## BrainStation Web API Hackathon Challenge
Build a front-end web application that fulfills the following requirements:
* Use HTML5, CSS3, Flexbox & Sass for structuring and building the UI
* Use appropriate BEM naming convention
* Use DOM APIs for adding/deleting/updating the elements on your page
* Use the fundamentals of programming in Javascript to write your logic. This would entail usage of variables, control flow statements, functions, loops & DOM APIs
* Demonstrate implementation of asynchronous programming concepts like promises, callbacks, event handlers
* Pick an API for your project and apply your asynchronous programming skills to call the required API in your project

### Tech Stack:
* HTML/CSS/Sass/JavaScript
